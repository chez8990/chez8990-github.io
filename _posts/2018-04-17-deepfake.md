Deepfake has had a lot of traction in the past few months, due to its unforseen application in the porn industry. Most people were interested to use it for their own pleasure but few people actually cared for the core technology. In this blog post we try to explore the architecture of deepfake and how deep learning is used to make this, seemingly miraculous, application possible.

### What is deepfake?
Deepfake is a deep learning based image recreation algorithm that allows users to superimpose facial images. It's been widely used to create fake celebrity pornogrphic videos. There was an entire subreddit dedicated to the maintainence and development of the "fakeapp" before its eventual demise. 

### Autoencoder
An autoencoder is a deep neural network that consists of three parts, an encoder, a decoder and a latent space.

The formulation is as follows:

Given an input vector \\( X \in \mathbb{R}^n \\), the encoder $ f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m $ does the following 

$$ Z = f(X) \in \mathbb{R}^m$$

where $$m\leq n $$. In other words, the encoder compresses the input to a lower dimensional vector space called the "latent space", correspondingly $$ Z $$ is called the "latent reprepsentation" of the input $$X$$.
